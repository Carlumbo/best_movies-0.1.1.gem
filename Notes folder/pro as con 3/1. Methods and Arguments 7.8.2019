***PROGRAMMING AS A CONVERSATION PART 3***
=begin
**************************************************
A paragrah in writing is a collection of sentences
designed of info transfer from speaker >> listener
opening and closing sentences and paragraphs have function
Code paragrpahs are functions, procedures, methods or subroutines
comprised of expressions and statements
make a sandwich  provides instructions as a commoand ie. get bread, pb , jelly
varibles such as retrive_picture encompases if user_name == nil 
this is an atomic activity, it implies actions to make the varible give a result 
*** Abstraction is the name of the game
meaning to pull away, we look at the larger details made of the small 
ruby calls bundles of statement (paragraphs) methods
***************************************************
methods and arguements 
=begin 
rememeber you can define a variable inside of a method 
when that varible is called on it will puts out whatever string with interpolation is insde of it
then you have to call on that varible using puts varible_name and it will put that out
so example is 
=end 
def outfit_choice(color,pants,head = "hat")
  puts "What are you going to wear?"
  outfit = "I am going to wear a #{color} shirt with my #{pants} along with a #{head}"
  puts outfit
  return outfit
end 
=begin
inside def method 
define variable 
puts local_varible 
return local_varible
end 
paramters are inside method defs 
arguements are inside method calls out of the methdo def
optional paramters/arguements are defiend like this 
def method(parameter, optional_parameter= "whatever")
  puts "string"
  local_varible = "this #{parameter} and this #{optional_parameter}"
  puts local_varible
  return local_varible
end
