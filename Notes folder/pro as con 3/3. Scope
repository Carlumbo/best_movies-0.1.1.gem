sometimes you cant access data, because its not in scope 
scopes exist in contect of time or place
if you order food at applebees and wait, ask the waiter where your food is they will know because you ordered there. 
if you ordered food at applebees and went accross the street to outback and asked a waiter there, they would not know.
*** Global Scope 
varibles assigned outside a method are global varibles
anywhere in ruby can access this
global varibles have $ signs as a symbol
*** Local scope 
local scope is only accessbile inside of the scope itself 
usually contained inside of a method 
ex 
def my_ruby_method
  puts local_varible
end
this local variable is contained
you have to define that local_variable inside of the methoid def or it will raise an error 
sometimes youll want to gloabally scope using the $varible allows it to cast its shawdow into all scopes
