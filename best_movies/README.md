# BestMovies

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/best_movies`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

The BestMovies parses the website ranker and puts the results into a database of movie info. The user can input a number into the CLI and it will retrieve the movie with that corrresponding number rank, actors, and synopsis. Then the user can review the total list of movies, select other movies from the list or exit.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'best_movies'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install best_movies

## Usage

When you want to watch a movie, want it to be good and dont feel like thinking too much. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
